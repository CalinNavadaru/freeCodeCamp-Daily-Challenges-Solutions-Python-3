This repository contains my Python3 solutions for the daily challenges from freeCodeCamp.

## File and Directories Structure
- Each solution is a `.py` file.
- Filenames follow the format: `YYYY_MM_DD.py` (year_month_day).
- Directories group the solutions by year and month: `YYYY_MM` (year_month).

## Usage
